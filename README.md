# PLP Python 5 Assignment

This repository contains two Python files demonstrating key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:

## Files

### 1. Encapsulation.py
This file demonstrates the concept of **Encapsulation** in Python. Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a class. It also restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse.

### 2. Polymorphism.py
This file demonstrates the concept of **Polymorphism** in Python. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is most often used when different classes have methods with the same name, and the correct method is called based on the object's class.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal in this directory.
3. Run either file using:
   ```powershell
   python Encapsulation.py
   python Polymorphism.py
   ```
